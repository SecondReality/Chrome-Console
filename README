Chrome Console

Provides access to the Windows console from inside Google Chrome.

Q.	What? Why would you do that?
A.	Mainly because the Windows command line program (cmd.exe) isn't very good:
	* It doesn't allow pasting by default
	* The window isn't fully resizable
	* Has a limited text history
	* Has limited customisation options
	* Doesn't have a multi-session interface (i.e. tabs)
	This project aims to solve the above problems.

Current Status of the project:
The project is functional, but needs a lot of work doing:
	* Testing needs to be done
	* Code needs to be cleaned up (redundant comments removed)
	* Code needs to be reviewed - possible memory leaks
	* Proper acknowledgement to all sources needs to be given
	* A lot of work needs doing on the user interface
	* Customisation options need to be added
	
How to test:
In Chrome open the extensions page, go to developer mode and choose Load unpacked extension. Select the "chrome" subdirectory.
